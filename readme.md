# BeatSaber - CustomColors

Edit your colors in `\Beat Saber\UserData\modprefs.ini`:
```
[CustomColors]
LeftRed=255
LeftGreen=0
LeftBlue=0
RightRed=0
RightGreen=0
RightBlue=255
OverrideCustomSabers=1
```

Run the game once to have these populated for you!

## Why a new repo?

I just wanted custom colors working again - Ikeiwa, if you're reading - feel free to take this work and use it yourself!
